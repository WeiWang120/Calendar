Creative portion:
1.Have tag for each event and show events with same tag by click on button
2.Live time showing on top left corner
3.Highlight today on calendar
4.You can choose a month to view by typing the correct format of year and month


the calendar.js(given on wiki) can't pass JSHint since the "Month" is not used in that file
